    "## Potential Energy Surface (PES)\n",
    "\n",
    "The potential energy surface (PES) of a molecular system describes its energy in terms of geometric parameters such as internuclear distances. For diatomic molecules with only one degree of freedom, i.e. one bond length, the surface is reduced to a potential energy curve or Morse potential.\n",

    "\n",
    "Knowledge of the PES allows the exploration of molecular properties, such as atomization or binding energy, and equilibrium bond lengths for various molecules. For more complex molecules, the optimal equilibrium bond lengths and angles for molecules can be studied. Also, the PES along a particular path can be used to map the energy changes in chemical reactions, allowing study of reaction energies and activation barriers.\n",

    "### Molecular Hamiltonian\n",
    "\n",
    "The energy of the molecular system is the eigenvalues $E$ of Molecular Hamiltonian. $\\hat{H}$ the represents the sum of the Kinetic and Potential energy operator of the whole molecule which consists of the electrons and nucleus. Finding the eigenvalues $E$ requires one to solve the time-independent Schrödinger Equation: \n",

    "$$\\hat{H}|\\phi_E\\rangle=E|\\phi_E\\rangle$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Without getting into too much detail about the chemistry, the Molecular Hamiltonian is usually expressed as a tensor (a generalised matrix) in terms of $m$ eigenstates of the Molecule that has no effective electronic interactions, known as molecular orbitals. This tensor is then futher decomposed into a linear decomposition of Pauli Strings, $\\sigma_1 \\otimes \\ldots \\otimes \\sigma_m$, where $\\sigma \\in \\{I,X,Y,Z\\}$.\n",

    "### What is Disentangled UCC and Problem Inspired Ansatz?\n",
    "\n",
    "Disentangled UCC [[1]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10130) is a problem-inspired ansatz that is constructed based on established Quantum Chemistry methods. It is expected that a problem-inspired ansatz will naturally produce states close to the actual ground state solution, resulting in a good agreement of the ground state energy with the true solution. This ansatz uses Givens rotations circuit blocks which has a unique particle conservation property. It simply means that the ansatz will avoid quantum states that correspond to the wrong number of electrons. Givens rotations are highly suitable for Quantum Chemistry applications where most chemical problems do not involve changing total number of electrons. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, it is effective in narrowing the search in the expansive Hilbert space for a potential solution. Unfortunately, problem-inspired ansatze are much more difficult to implement on a real quantum hardware as they usually require deep quantum circuits which increase the unwanted effect of quantum hardware noise. This in turn greatly affects solution accuracies.\n"

The Hartree-Fock Ground State, $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ represents the ground state of a molecule without any effective electron interaction.

    "Effectively, the Disentangled UCC Ansatz state will become a linear combination of the Hartree-Fock Ground molecular state $|\\psi_0\\rangle$ and all other possible singly and doubly excited Hartree-Fock molecular basis state. Let us illustrate this using the simplest case of Hydrogen $H_2$ molecule with 2 electrons and 4 orbitals. The $H_2$ Hartree-Fock ground state is $|\\psi_0\\rangle=|1100\\rangle$ with 4 qubits. Disentangled UCC ansatz will becomes a linear combination of the following computational basis $\\{|1100\\rangle,|0110\\rangle,|0101\\rangle,|1010\\rangle,|1001\\rangle,|0011\\rangle\\}$ where each the basis represents a possible electronic configuration of hydrogen molecule.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that other quantum basis such as $|1110\\rangle$ or $|0010\\rangle$ must be excluded from the ground state as it does not have the correct occupation number. To generate UCCSD ansatz for the Hydrogen Molecule, we carefully apply each unique Singles and Doubles Excitation Rotation once on the Hartree-Fock State $|1100\\rangle$ such that all states are being generated without any redundant rotations.\n",
